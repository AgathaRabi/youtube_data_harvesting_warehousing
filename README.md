# streamlit installed

# test

# created API KEY

NET STEP:

## next step is accessing data from you tube
        ## for that we need to write a function
            ## before that get the needed packages

## downloading the package that would make the API key work
    ## pip install google-api-client

# import the downloaded package

## create the function for API connect

        ##Note: We get the Api_Id(key) by using the argument developerKey

# and then we call the function api_connect

NEXT STEP:

# Now……
	## get channel’s information
        	Supposed to create function to get channel info.
           Mean time get a youtube channels' 'Channel_Id' (from 'about' --->  'share')
